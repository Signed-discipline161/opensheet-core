# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- AI/RAG extraction functions: `xlsx_to_markdown()`, `xlsx_to_text()`, `xlsx_to_chunks()` for converting spreadsheets to LLM-friendly formats
- LangChain integration: `OpenSheetLoader` document loader with markdown, text, and chunks modes
- LlamaIndex integration: `OpenSheetReader` data reader compatible with `SimpleDirectoryReader`
- Automatic cell type unwrapping for extraction (Formula → cached value, FormattedCell → numeric value, StyledCell → inner value)

### Changed
- Fix benchmark measurement bias: replace `ru_maxrss` (high-water mark) with current RSS via platform-specific APIs (`proc_pidinfo` on macOS, `/proc/self/statm` on Linux)
- Interleave benchmark runs (`[A,B,A,B,...]` instead of `[A,A,A,B,B,B]`) to eliminate ordering bias
- Increase default benchmark runs from 3 to 5 for more stable results
- Report mean +/- stddev alongside min time and median memory
- Update README benchmark numbers to reflect accurate, unbiased measurements
- Add benchmarking methodology documentation (`docs/benchmarking.md`)
- Add `langchain-core` and `llama-index-core` to CI for full integration test coverage

### Optimized
- Reduce read memory usage by ~25% via deferred shared-string resolution: store string indices during parsing, resolve to Python objects at the boundary
- Pre-intern shared strings as Python objects; repeated strings reuse the same object via `clone_ref()` instead of allocating new copies
- Convert-and-drop pattern: Rust row data is freed as Python objects are created, avoiding holding both representations simultaneously
- `read_sheet()` now only parses the requested worksheet instead of all sheets in the workbook
- `sheet_names()` now only parses `workbook.xml` instead of loading shared strings, styles, and worksheets
- Read memory improved from 18 MB to 13.5 MB (2.5x less than openpyxl, previously 2.6x more)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- Cell styling support: `CellStyle` and `StyledCell` types for fonts (bold, italic, underline, name, size, color), fills (solid color), borders (thin, medium, thick, dashed, dotted, double with per-side control), alignment (horizontal, vertical, wrap text, rotation), and number formats on styled cells
- Reader returns `StyledCell` for cells with visual styling; plain cells remain unchanged (backward compatible)
- Style deduplication in writer (identical styles share a single XF entry)
- `border` shorthand parameter on `CellStyle` sets all four sides at once, with per-side overrides
- Column width support: `set_column_width()` on writer, `"column_widths"` in reader output
- Row height support: `set_row_height()` on writer, `"row_heights"` in reader output
- Freeze panes support: `freeze_panes()` on writer, `"freeze_pane"` in reader output
- Auto-filter support: `auto_filter()` on writer, `"auto_filter"` in reader output
- Number format support: `FormattedCell(value, format_code)` for writing cells with custom number formats (currency, percentage, custom format strings); reader returns `FormattedCell` for formatted number cells
- Pandas integration: `read_xlsx_df()` reads XLSX sheets into DataFrames, `to_xlsx()` writes DataFrames to XLSX; install with `pip install opensheet-core[pandas]`

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-30

### Changed
- Limit Dependabot Cargo updates to patch-only, monthly
- Add Codecov test results reporting to CI
- Add project infrastructure (CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md, issue templates)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- Streaming XLSX reader with typed cell extraction (strings, numbers, booleans, dates, datetimes, formulas, empty cells)
- Streaming XLSX writer with constant memory usage
- Formula read/write support with optional cached values
- Date and datetime cell support with automatic Excel serial number conversion
- Merged cell metadata (read and write)
- `read_xlsx()` to read all sheets from a workbook
- `read_sheet()` to read a single sheet by name or index
- `sheet_names()` to list sheet names in a workbook
- `XlsxWriter` with context manager support
- `Formula` type for formula cells
- Python type stubs (`.pyi`) and `py.typed` marker for IDE autocomplete
- Prebuilt wheels for Linux (x86_64, aarch64), macOS (x86_64, aarch64), and Windows (x64)
- CI across Linux, macOS, and Windows for Python 3.9-3.13
- Benchmarks vs openpyxl with runnable benchmark script
- Zero Python dependencies
